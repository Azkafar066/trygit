<p>Basketball (English: basketball) is a group ball sport consisting of two teams of five people each competing to score points by putting the ball into the opponent's basket. Basketball can be played on open courts, although professional games are generally played in closed spaces. The required playing field is also relatively small, for example compared to football. Apart from that, basketball games are also more competitive because the tempo of the game tends to be faster when compared to other ball sports, such as volleyball and football.
    Basketball is one of the most popular sports among residents of the United States and residents in other parts of the world, including in South America, Southern Europe, Lithuania and also in Indonesia. Many basketball competitions are held every year, such as the British Basketball League (BBL) in England, the National Basketball Association (NBA) in America, and the Indonesian Basketball League (IBL) in Indonesia.[4] Basketball is a sport that demands a high VO2 max. With training, VO2 max can be increased, resulting in an increase of only around 25% from the initial training condition. The remainder of this exercise is determined by the physical potential of each individual. Basketball is a sport with longer rest periods, so you can utilize proper recovery techniques.History
    In 1891, Dr. James Naismith, a Canadian sports teacher who teaches at a college for professional students at the YMCA (a Christian youth organization) in Springfield, Massachusetts, had to create an indoor game to fill the students' time during the winter holidays in New England. Inspired by a game he played as a child in Ontario, Naismith created the game now known as basketball on December 15, 1891.[7][8]
    According to the story, after rejecting several ideas because they were considered too hard and not suitable for playing in closed arenas, he then wrote down some basic rules, attached a basket to the wall of the sports arena, and asked the students to start playing the game he created. Unlike modern basketball baskets, the baskets used at that time did not have holes, so the incoming ball had to be removed manually. Of course, this method is not efficient, so the bottom of the basket is hollowed out so the ball can come out.
    The first official game was played at the YMCA gymnasium in Albany, New York, on January 20, 1892, with nine players. The game finished with the score 1â€“0; and played on a court half the size of an NBA court.
    Frank Mahan, one of the first players of the game, approached Naismith, in early 1892, with the intention of asking Naismith the name of his new game. Naismith replied that he had not thought about it as he was focused on starting the game. Mahan suggested the name "Naismith ball", at which Naismith laughed, saying such a name would kill the game. Mahan then said, "Why not basketball?" Naismith replied, "we have a basket (basketball) and a ball, that would be a good name." 
    At first, each team consisted of nine people and there was no dribble, so the ball could only move through throws. The history of basketball game rules begins with 13 basic rules written by James Naismith himself.Court, time and number of basketball players
