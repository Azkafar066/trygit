<h1 >Football is one of the most popular sports in the world, including in Indonesia. Football is a type of sport, the art of handling the ball, which is played by a team consisting of 11 players.
    Football is known to have existed and been known for a long time, even from BC. Until now, football is still growing in various parts of the world.
    Even though the game of soccer is now synonymous with being popular with men, there are quite a few women who like it and also play.In the game of soccer, the main goal is to score as many goals as possible by putting the ball into the opponent's goal. Apart from that, the game also requires a high level of sportsmanship between players, both friends and opponents.History of World Football
    The history of the sport of football began in the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC in China.
    During the Han Dynasty, Chinese people are known to have known the game of dribbling a leather ball by kicking it into a small net-shaped goal. The ball game is called Tsu Chu.
    However, the sport which was later called football was not previously played by ordinary people. At that time, football was played by Chinese soldiers to maintain their physical condition. On the other hand, they also played as a means of entertainment when there was an emperor's birthday celebration.
        Similar games have also been found in other countries, specifically in Japan. If in China it was called Tsu chu, then the ball game in Japan at that time was known as Kemari. Similar to China, at that time the Japanese played by dribbling a ball made from deer skin.
        Based on historical records, not only in China and Japan, but ancient soccer games were also found in other countries such as Rome, England, Mexico, Central America and even ancient Egypt, which played soccer using balls made of rubber.Football is starting to become known in the school environment
    As time progressed, football became known not only in small areas but also in universities and schools. This development began to be seen in 1815 and continued to develop until around 1900.
        At that time, modern football began to develop in England after a meeting was held by 11 representatives of existing football associations at the Football Association Freemasons Tavern in London in 1863.
        The results of the meeting then established the basic rules for playing football in Wales, Scotland and Ireland.
        Football became increasingly popular after British sailors, traders and soldiers became familiar with it throughout the 19th century. Until finally in 1904, in line with the development of football in European countries, the world's highest football association was formed, called the Federation International de Football Association (FIFA).History of Football in Indonesia
        In Indonesia itself, the game of modern football is known to have been brought by the Dutch during the colonial era. The first football organization established in Indonesia was the Nederland Indische Voetbal Bond (NIVB).
         At that time, football on the island of Java was only played by Dutch people and educated people who had access. This means that modern football has not yet become a popular sport.
        Then, as football developed in the world, this sport also increasingly developed in Indonesia. It was recorded that in 1915, football clubs started to emerge which were led by Chinese citizens in Indonesia.
                Then in 1920, clubs such as UMS Jakarta and Surabaya managed to become the greatest clubs in Dutch East Indies football.
                Several years after that, the All Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) was formed which was founded in Yogyakarta on April 19 1930. The first PSSI leader at that time was Soeratin Sosrosoegondo, as reported on the official PSSI website.
                The founding of PSSI had the aim of using football as a tool to spread the spirit of nationalism among youth and oppose Dutch colonialism.
                After the founding of PSSI, annual competitions in Indonesia began to run from 1931 to 1941. The competition stopped from 1942 to 1950 when Japan began to colonize Indonesia until the early days of independence. Only after that in 1951 PSSI started running again.</h1>
